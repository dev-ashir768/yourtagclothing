      <p><strong>ARTICLE 11 - ORDER PLACEMENT</strong></p>

      <p><strong>11.1 - PURCHASE PROCESS:</strong> By clicking on the Products&#39; photographs or item designations, you will have access to their full details and characteristics.</p>

      <p>By selecting the Product you wish to purchase and indicating the quantity of items you want, and then clicking on the &quot;Add to cart&quot; button, the Product/s will be placed in a virtual shopping cart.</p>

      <p>By clicking on the pictogram representing a shopping cart or bag, at the top right of the Website page, you will have access to a summary page of the Product selection you have just made, with details on all of the Products you have added, and various options concerning the purchase order.</p>

      <p>When you want to place the order of the Products in your virtual shopping cart, you can continue the procedure by clicking on the &quot;Checkout&quot; button.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If you have already registered your Personal/Company Account and have not yet logged in, you can log on at this stage with your username and password in order to automatically use your saved data to place your order. Otherwise, you can register by creating a Personal/Company Account or continue shopping without creating an account, i.e. purchasing as a &quot;Guest&quot;. In this Guest mode of purchase, you will only be asked for the essential data to be able to process your order. Additionally, you may place your order directly through the &quot;Express Checkout&quot; option or through your Facebook or Google account credentials.</p>

      <p>When using a Company Account you will be entitled to deduct VAT only if you have included your VAT details when placing the order, except in USA and Canada; otherwise, VAT will not be refunded.</p>

      <p>In order to confirm your purchase order, you will need to specify the relevant invoicing information, shipping information and delivery options, as well as the payment method details that suit you best (e.g., credit/debit card number, validity date and security cryptogram on the back of the payment card; payment processor account information; bank transfer/debit information, or other) and then proceed to payment.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>It is specified that your bank details will not be kept either by the Website or by yourtagclothing, except it is strictly necessary, properly encrypted and for a limited period of time, in compliance with all current and applicable financial and banking data protection regulations (e.g., PCI DSS).</p>

      <p>Once the purchase process has been completed and confirmed, a purchase order will be issued to you (&quot;<strong>Order</strong>&quot;). After a few moments, we will send you an email confirming your Order, reminding you of the content of the Order and the price of it.</p>

      <p>Your order, once confirmed and paid, constitutes a binding sales contract as set forth in Article 9.</p>

      <p><strong>11.2 - PURCHASE CONDITIONS:</strong> The Products sold shall remain the property of yourtagclothing or the Suppliers until payment in full of the price thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the &quot;Retention of title&quot; section below.</p>

      <p>We reserve the right to decline or cancel any purchase order for which there may be a dispute concerning the payment of one or more previous orders.</p>

      <p>You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate order and Personal/Company Account information for all purchase orders placed on the Website. You agree to promptly update your Personal/Company Account and other information, including your email address and credit/debit card details, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you if necessary.</p>

      <p>When the ordered Products are delivered from abroad, depending on the warehouse location, you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are collected when the package arrives at its destination. Any additional customs clearance costs will be your responsibility; we have no control over these charges. Customs policies vary greatly from country to country, so you should contact the local customs department for more information. Additionally, please note that when ordering from yourtagclothing, you may be considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you receive the Products.</p>

      <p>We may have to cancel your Order due to payment processing issues. In such an unlikely case, you can contact us to seek for an alternative solution (e.g., another payment method) and then you can click on the &quot;Order Again&quot; button on your Order Page to repeat the Order.</p>

      <p>In the unlikely event that the selected Product/s becomes &quot;Out of Stock&quot; or &quot;Unavailable&quot; while processing your Order, we will automatically send you a coupon code for the price of the Product that is out of stock/unavailable, but you will also have the possibility to exchange the coupon for a reimbursement within the timeframe and conditions set out below for returns and refunds.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>ARTICLE 13 - DELIVERIES</strong></p>

      <p><strong>13.1 - ORDER PROCESSING AND SHIPPING: </strong>When we have reviewed and checked that your purchase order is correct, we will process the Order with our Suppliers and/or warehouse before shipping the Products via delivery service provider (&quot;<strong>Transporter</strong>&quot;) to the address indicated by you in the Order.</p>

      <p>The available Transporters will be displayed on the Website, ensuring that the delivery is made under appropriate conditions. Once the Product has been shipped, we will send you an email informing you about the dispatch of the Order, including the tracking number provided by the Transporter, as well as instructions to track the shipment online.</p>

      <p>yourtagclothing will endeavour to ensure that the Product/s purchased by you are delivered within a reasonable time frame from the Order confirmation email. However, delivery dates are not guaranteed and may vary due to several factors, including but not limited to: production delays for certain products (e.g., multiple prints per t-shirt), large orders (e.g., over fifty Products), post office box deliveries, payment authorization and verification, issues with uploaded custom designs, regional holidays, customs clearance, order information errors, Supplier or Transporter issues, weather conditions, delivery complications in remote areas, or other operational factors beyond our control.</p>

      <p>If we are unable to meet an agreed delivery date, we will inform you as soon as possible and give you the option to either proceed with the purchase with a new delivery date or cancel the Order and offer you a refund in the form of a reimbursement or a coupon, subject to the conditions set out below for returns and refunds.</p>

      <p>Unless in exceptional circumstances, deliveries are not made on Saturdays, Sundays, or public holidays for the Transporter, in which case delivery will resume on the next working day.</p>

      <p><strong>13.2 - DELIVERY ISSUES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:</strong> yourtagclothing will not assume any responsibility when the delivery of a Product does not take place or is delayed due to inaccurate or false information provided by you in the Order, or if the delivery cannot be made for reasons beyond our control, such as force majeure, non-deliverability, or abandonment (e.g., not picking up the product at the collection point in time).</p>

      <p>The packing/shipping labels validated by the Transporter shall be considered proof of shipment. Delivery of the Products is deemed to have taken place from the moment they are made available to you. If a Transporter is unable to deliver a package due to unforeseen circumstances beyond our control, such as natural disasters or service disruptions, we will make reasonable efforts to assist in resolving the issue but cannot be held responsible for non-deliverability in such cases.</p>

      <p>If a package is returned to us as undeliverable and the Customer does not respond to our contact attempts to arrange redelivery or provide an alternative address within 30 days, the package will be considered abandoned. We will then understand that you wish to withdraw from the Contract, and we shall consider it terminated. The Customer may be liable for any additional shipping and handling fees for reattempting delivery or for storage.</p>

      <p>All Products purchased on the Website will be delivered in a secure package. Upon receipt of your package, you must check the conformity of the Product/s delivered at the time of delivery by opening your package in the presence of the Transporter. In the event of any anomaly in the delivery, you must immediately inform the Transporter, referring to the damage on the proof of delivery document, and our customer service using our <a href="/display/contact">Contact Form</a>. You declare and acknowledge that a proof of delivery without reference to any damages presumes that there was no damage, corresponding to a Product delivered in perfect packaging conditions. If you detect any damage to the Product after opening the packaging, you have twenty-four (24) hours after acceptance of the Order to contact us and report the incident using our <a href="/display/contact">Contact Form</a>. Since we are not in charge of the delivery of the Product, we will initiate an investigation with the Transporter. In any case, you undertake to provide all evidence allowing us to file a claim with the Transporter.</p>

      <p>If we are unable to deliver the ordered Product/s due to the Suppliers&#39; failure, for reasons for which we cannot be held responsible, we shall have the right to withdraw from the Contract. In this case, we will inform you immediately and offer you a refund in the form of a reimbursement or a coupon, deducting additional costs that may result from your choice of a delivery method other than the standard delivery method offered by us.</p>

      <p>To report an item not received, you should contact us via our <a href="/display/contact">Contact Form</a>.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>ARTICLE 14 - PAYMENT TERMS</strong></p>

      <p><strong>14.1 - PRICE: </strong>The prices of the Products are indicated in the legal currency including the corresponding value added tax (VAT) or other taxes, where applicable, depending on the country where the Products are delivered, but excluding shipping costs.</p>

      <p>Prices may vary at any time, depending on the Supplies&rsquo; pricing lists and the pricing policy of the various manufacturers, so we reserve the right to modify the prices at any time, at our sole discretion, and without notice. We will invoice you on the basis of the price in force at the time of the Order.</p>

      <p>If we discover an unlikely error in the price of any Product/s you have ordered, we will inform you as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming the Order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you, the Order will be treated as cancelled and if you have already paid for the Product/s you will receive a full refund.</p>

      <p>We are under no obligation to sell the Product/s to you at an incorrect price, even after we have sent you the Order confirmation email, if the pricing error is an obvious typographical or arithmetical inaccuracy and could have reasonably been recognized by you as such.</p>

      <p><strong>14.2 - PAYMENT METHODS:</strong> The available payment methods will be displayed on the Website.</p>

      <p>Credit/debit card payments are made through secure transactions provided by an online payment platform. Credit/debit card payments will be subject to verification and authorisation by the credit/debit card entity. If the credit/debit card entity delays or does not authorise the payment, we will not be responsible for any delay or non-delivery since we will be entitled to withhold the shipping until payment or to cancel your Order and lawfully terminate the Contract with you without any liability.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>By proceeding with the payment you are confirming that the credit/debit card is yours and/or that you are the legitimate holder of the voucher or gift card.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>14.3 - INVOICING: </strong>The Customer expressly consents to the Order invoice being issued in digital format using the information provided by you during the purchase process.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If you have registered under a Company Account will have the option to provide your VAT number, which will appear on the electronic invoice of each Order. Also, at checkout you will have the option to confirm whether the shipping information is the same as the billing information or to specify a different one. If you have any special billing requirements or need to include any additional information in the invoice about the purchasing company, you should contact us via our <a href="/display/contact">Contact Form</a>.</p>

      <p>For Company Accounts who are entitled to deduct the VAT, it is mandatory to include the VAT details in the checkout when placing an Order, or otherwise VAT will not be refunded.</p>

      <p>In accordance with the applicable laws and regulations governing the value added tax to the sale of goods and services, the place of supply shall be deemed to be the location where the goods are delivered, and the applicable taxes shall be those in force in that jurisdiction. Consequently, the company issuing invoices may vary from the company operating this Website, depending on the country where the Products are delivered, contingent upon the existence of a subsidiary company within the Netenders Group in that country. This variation can impact the inclusion of value-added tax or equivalent taxes on the invoice, potentially resulting in changes to the total invoice amount in certain instances.</p>

      <p>Payment by wire transfers will not be processed until confirmed within 48 hours.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Should you wish to receive the invoice in hard copy, you may request this at any time by contacting us via our <a href="/display/contact">Contact Form</a>.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>14.4 - SHIPPING COSTS: </strong>Shipping costs are at your expense and are invoiced in addition to the sale price of the Products, except in the case of &quot;Free Shipping&quot; offers under specific conditions expressly stipulated on the Website.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The shipping costs are determined based on the place of delivery and the size of your Order.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>ARTICLE 15 - RETENTION OF TITLE&nbsp;</strong></p>

      <p>The Products sold shall remain the property of yourtagclothing or the Suppliers, as the case may be, until they are paid for in full, or at the time of delivery, whichever is the latter. However, the risks related to the Products shall be borne by you from the time of the delivery of the Products.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>It is strictly forbidden to pledge, give them as security, transform them or modify them before the transfer of ownership.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>ARTICLE 16 - RETURN POLICY</strong></p>

      <p>We do not accept cancellations or replacements, if you do not want the Order you must follow the return procedures according to this policy.</p>

      </ul>

      <p>However, the Consumer is not obliged to give any reason or justification.</p>

      <p><strong><em>First Steps</em></strong></p>

      <p>Upon delivery of the Products you must inspect them thoroughly and without delay to note any discrepancies or apparent defects. You must treat the Products with care, since we will undertake to refund the returned Product provided that it is returned intact, in its original protective packaging, in the same condition as when it was received, without trace of use, and accompanied by the documents specified below.</p>

      <p>Any Product returned without observing these Terms and Conditions will not be refunded.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If the Products are received directly by a partner, a printer, or any other third party, they will be considered as delivered, so we suggest that these third parties imperatively examine the Products before proceeding to use them, customise them, or manipulate them in any other way. If you do not request a return within the Return Period, the Products delivered&nbsp; shall be deemed approved, and your right to withdraw from the Contract shall be terminated.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Return Procedure</em></strong></p>

      <p>If you notice any visible issues such as damage, incorrect, or missing items, immediately request a return through your Order Page by clicking the &quot;Request Return&quot; button to initiate the return procedure as soon as possible within the Return Period. Prompt action will help ensure that any problems are resolved quickly and efficiently.</p>

      <p>To exercise the right of withdrawal you must consider the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>When making a return request it is important that you provide us with the necessary information to help us return your Product, including the following:</p>

      <p>- A photo of the complete delivery note or invoice with the items delivered.</p>

      <p>- A photo of the outer packaging.</p>

      <p>- A photo of the opened box where the packaging protection can be seen.</p>

      <p>- A photo of the damage or defect on the Product.</p>

      <p>- A photo of the entire Product.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Instructions:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>After receiving the completed return request, we will contact you via email to provide&nbsp;</p>

      <p>you with instructions for returning the Product.</p>

      <p>You must not return the Product without first reading the email instructions carefully.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Return rules:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Product/s must be returned accompanied by its original purchase invoice, and/or the delivery note provided at the time of your Order.</p>

      <p>You are fully responsible for the return, including choosing a suitable shipping carrier and covering all the return shipping costs, unless otherwise stated.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>For certain eligible returns, a return label and receipt will be emailed to you for shipping the products via our designated Carrier. If this applies to your case, both documents must be printed: the return label should be affixed to the outside of the package, and the return receipt must be placed inside the package. Additionally, you must ensure you provide us with proof of shipment, including a tracking number, once the package has been sent. Please note that return options may not be available in all regions, depending on local logistics limitations. Regardless of the return label we provide, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund, unless you opt for a refund in the form of a coupon code, in which case we will cover the return shipping costs.</p>

      <p>Return shipping costs depend on the Supplier and the warehouse location of each Product, and on the size of the Order.</p>

      <p>If you have provided a valid business identification number or VAT number, whether you purchased under a Personal Account, a Company Account, or as a Guest, all non-defective Product/s returned may be subject to a restocking fee of up to 30% of the purchase price, in addition to the return shipping cost, depending on the size of the Order and the charges from our Supplier.</p>

      <p>Make sure the return slip is included inside the package. If the return slip is missing and we are unable to identify the return at our warehouse, your refund may be delayed or additional charges may apply.</p>

      <p>You must return the Product/s within fourteen (14) calendar days from the withdrawal to the address that will be indicated to you as per the instructions mentioned above.</p>

      <p>You will be responsible for complying with the return procedure. If the Products are sent to an address other than the one we have indicated to you, we reserve the right to refrain from any refund or, if possible, take the necessary operational actions at your expense.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exceptional cases:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have selected &quot;Late Delivery&quot; as the reason for your withdrawal,&nbsp; you may be eligible for a full refund, inclusive of return shipping costs. This exception applies only if you can provide proof that you explicitly communicated the time-sensitive nature or specific event requirement for the Product at the time of purchase, and we acknowledged and agreed to that timeframe.</p>

      <p>In specific situations, a refund may be processed without the need to return the Product. This applies, for instance, if the selected reason for withdrawal is <em>&quot;Defective or Damaged&quot;</em> Products, as previously described, or if <em>&quot;Package Lost&quot;</em> was selected, indicating the Products were never received.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please also note that you are solely responsible for ensuring that the return parcel, whether under the right of withdrawal or for any other reason, is delivered to the correct return address.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>We shall not be held liable for return parcels that are lost, delayed, misdirected, or not delivered for any reason.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Failure to ensure proper delivery may result in the denial of any refund.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inspection:&nbsp;</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Upon receipt of the returned Product/s, we will acknowledge receipt by email. After examining the returned Product/s according to the requirements stated herein, we will reasonably decide whether the return is definitely approved and the refund accordingly.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Refund Procedure</em></strong></p>

      <p>After we examine the returned Product and verify compliance with these terms, the refund will be approved and processed according to the type of refund you have selected in your return request: reimbursement or coupon.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Should you opt for a <strong>reimbursement</strong>, we will repay you by using the same payment method used for the initial transaction. Should the original payment method be not valid anymore for whatever reason (e.g., account deleted or credit card expired), you must specify it in the comment section of your return request, expressly detailing the reason and the preferred method of payment. The refund amount will be calculated according to the rules and deductions outlined above (e.g., return shipping costs, restocking fees, etc.). Reimbursement will be issued within fourteen (14) days, barring circumstances beyond our reasonable control. However, we reserve the right to postpone the refund if we have not yet received the returned Products for inspection in such a period of time.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Should you opt for a <strong>coupon</strong>, a coupon code will be issued within fourteen (14) days for use on our Website at checkout for another purchase. This code will have a reasonably extended validity period. The refund will cover the full amount paid for the relevant Product, without any deductions, unless restocking fees are applicable.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong><em>Return Exceptions</em></strong></p>

      <p>As permitted by law, your right of withdrawal does not apply in the following cases:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Products labelled as <em>&ldquo;Non-Returnable&rdquo;</em> or with similar labelling on the product page or at checkout cannot be returned or refunded for any reason, unless they have a proven and confirmed manufacturing defect. <em>(This exception applies only to purchases made in the United States and Canada.)</em></li>
        <li>Products that are manufactured or produced in accordance with an individual choice or specification or according to personalised needs or designs, including the Custom Orders pursuant to Article 12 above.</li>
        <li>Products that have been altered from their original condition, worn, or washed.</li>
        <li>Products which have been unsealed after delivery and which cannot be returned for reasons of hygiene or health protection, including but not limited to underwear, swimwear, hygiene masks, and any other items we reasonably consider to fall into this category.</li>
        <li>Products likely to deteriorate or expire rapidly.</li>
        <li>Alcoholic beverages, if the price was agreed at the time of purchase, delivery is only possible after 30 days, and the final value is subject to market fluctuations beyond our control.</li>
        <li>Products that have been inseparably mixed with other products due to their texture, after delivery.</li>
        <li>Any other products or services excluded by current regulations.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>ARTICLE 17 - WARRANTY</strong></p>

      <p><strong>17.1 - WARRANTY CONDITIONS:</strong> You are entitled to legal warranties in accordance with the applicable law and regulations on customer protection and e-commerce sale of goods, for the lack of conformity or hidden defects that exists at the time of delivery of the Product/s if the defect becomes apparent within 1-5 years depending on the applicable provincial law thereafter, unless a longer warranty period is provided by law.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>However, no special quality of the goods to be delivered is agreed upon. The delivered Products shall only be considered defective or non-conforming if they do not meet the technical specifications of their description or in the relevant advertising available at or before the conclusion of the Contract.</p>

      <p>You may invoke the warranty against hidden defects, provided that the defects presented <strong>(i) </strong>did not appear at the time of delivery; <strong>(ii)</strong> existed prior to the purchase (and therefore do not result from normal wear and tear of the Product, for example), and <strong>(iii)</strong> are sufficiently serious (the defect must either render the Product unfit for the use for which it is intended, or diminish such use to such an extent that the Customer would not have purchased the Product or would not have purchased it at such a price if he had known of the defect).</p>

      <p>In the event of such a lack of conformity under the aforementioned conditions, you have the right to a price reduction through a coupon code discount or to terminate the Contract and request a refund, depending on the extent of the defect.</p>

      <p><strong>17.2 - EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT TO THE WARRANTY: </strong>&nbsp;To exercise the right of warranty you must request a return by following the instructions outlined in Article 16, Section &quot;Return Procedure&quot;.</p>

      <p>All requests must be accompanied by:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your Order number.</li>
        <li>The description of the defect and how it appeared.</li>
        <li>A photo or video of the defect supporting your complaint and allowing our Customer Service team to assess the case.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After verification and validation of the defect, we will offer you a refund in the form of a reimbursement or coupon, with the same rules outlined above.</p>

      <p>Any refund request made in exercising the right of warranty without complying with the conditions set out herein will not be considered.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>17.3 - WARRANTY EXCEPTIONS:</strong> The warranty for the lack of conformity or hidden defects does not apply under the following circumstances:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visible or External Factors:</strong> Defects are not hidden or are caused by external factors outside the control of yourtagclothing or the Supplier, including but not limited to acts of force majeure, accidents, or other unforeseeable events.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Normal Wear and Tear:</strong> The defect results from normal wear and tear or the natural ageing of the Product.</li>
        <li><strong>Improper Use or Lack of Maintenance:</strong> The Product is used in a manner incompatible with its nature or inconsistent with the instructions, guidelines, or specifications provided by yourtagclothing or the Supplier, or reasonable routine maintenance or repair is not performed according to the Supplier&#39;s recommendations.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect Handling:</strong> Defects arise due to incorrect configuration, installation, alteration, or handling by the Customer or any third party not authorised by yourtagclothing. This includes using parts or components not supplied or approved by yourtagclothing or the Supplier.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorised Modifications:</strong> The Customer applies substances, makes modifications, or undertakes actions that directly affect the Product for purposes not designed or intended and that could not have been reasonably anticipated by yourtagclothing or the Supplier.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Notwithstanding the above, the Products will be deemed to be in conformity with the Contract provided that <strong>(i) </strong>they conform to the description given by us and possess the specifications which we have set out on the Website, <strong>(ii)</strong> they are suitable for the uses for which products of the same type are normally intended and reasonably expected.</p>
