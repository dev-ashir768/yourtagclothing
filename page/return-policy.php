      </ul>

      <p>However, the Consumer is not obliged to give any reason or justification.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>First Steps</em></strong></p>

      <p>Upon delivery of the Products you must inspect them thoroughly and without delay to note any discrepancies or apparent defects. You must treat the Products with care, since we will undertake to refund the returned Product provided that it is returned intact, in its original protective packaging, in the same condition as when it was received, without trace of use, and accompanied by the documents specified below.</p>

      <p>Any Product returned without observing these Terms and Conditions will not be refunded.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>If the Products are received directly by a partner, a printer, or any other third party, they will be considered as delivered, so we suggest that these third parties imperatively examine the Products before proceeding to use them, customise them, or manipulate them in any other way. If you do not request a return within the Return Period, the Products delivered&nbsp; shall be deemed approved, and your right to withdraw from the Contract shall be terminated.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Return Procedure</em></strong></p>

      <p>If you notice any visible issues such as damage, incorrect, or missing items, immediately request a return through your Order Page by clicking the &quot;Request Return&quot; button to initiate the return procedure as soon as possible within the Return Period. Prompt action will help ensure that any problems are resolved quickly and efficiently.</p>


      <p>To exercise the right of withdrawal you must consider the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Proof:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>When making a return request it is important that you provide us with the necessary information to help us return your Product, including the following:</p>

      <p>- A photo of the complete delivery note or invoice with the items delivered.</p>

      <p>- A photo of the outer packaging.</p>

      <p>- A photo of the opened box where the packaging protection can be seen.</p>

      <p>- A photo of the damage or defect on the Product.</p>

      <p>- A photo of the entire Product.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Instructions:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>After receiving the completed return request, we will contact you via email to provide&nbsp;</p>

      <p>you with instructions for returning the Product.</p>

      <p>You must not return the Product without first reading the email instructions carefully.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Return rules:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Product/s must be returned accompanied by its original purchase invoice, and/or the delivery note provided at the time of your Order.</p>

      <p>You are fully responsible for the return, including choosing a suitable shipping carrier and covering all the return shipping costs, unless otherwise stated.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>For certain eligible returns, a return label and receipt will be emailed to you for shipping the products via our designated Carrier. If this applies to your case, both documents must be printed: the return label should be affixed to the outside of the package, and the return receipt must be placed inside the package. Additionally, you must ensure you provide us with proof of shipment, including a tracking number, once the package has been sent. Please note that return options may not be available in all regions, depending on local logistics limitations. Regardless of the return label we provide, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund, unless you opt for a refund in the form of a coupon code, in which case we will cover the return shipping costs.</p>

      <p>Return shipping costs depend on the Supplier and the warehouse location of each Product, and on the size of the Order.</p>

      <p>If you have provided a valid business identification number or VAT number, whether you purchased under a Personal Account, a Company Account, or as a Guest, all non-defective Product/s returned may be subject to a restocking fee of up to 30% of the purchase price, in addition to the return shipping cost, depending on the size of the Order and the charges from our Supplier.</p>

      <p>Make sure the return slip is included inside the package. If the return slip is missing and we are unable to identify the return at our warehouse, your refund may be delayed or additional charges may apply.</p>

      <p>You must return the Product/s within fourteen (14) calendar days from the withdrawal to the address that will be indicated to you as per the instructions mentioned above.</p>

      <p>You will be responsible for complying with the return procedure. If the Products are sent to an address other than the one we have indicated to you, we reserve the right to refrain from any refund or, if possible, take the necessary operational actions at your expense.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exceptional cases:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have selected &quot;Late Delivery&quot; as the reason for your withdrawal,&nbsp; you may be eligible for a full refund, inclusive of return shipping costs. This exception applies only if you can provide proof that you explicitly communicated the time-sensitive nature or specific event requirement for the Product at the time of purchase, and we acknowledged and agreed to that timeframe.</p>

      <p>In specific situations, a refund may be processed without the need to return the Product. This applies, for instance, if the selected reason for withdrawal is <em>&quot;Defective or Damaged&quot;</em> Products, as previously described, or if <em>&quot;Package Lost&quot;</em> was selected, indicating the Products were never received.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Please also note that you are solely responsible for ensuring that the return parcel, whether under the right of withdrawal or for any other reason, is delivered to the correct return address.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>We shall not be held liable for return parcels that are lost, delayed, misdirected, or not delivered for any reason.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Failure to ensure proper delivery may result in the denial of any refund.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inspection:&nbsp;</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Upon receipt of the returned Product/s, we will acknowledge receipt by email. After examining the returned Product/s according to the requirements stated herein, we will reasonably decide whether the return is definitely approved and the refund accordingly.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Refund Procedure</em></strong></p>

      <p>After we examine the returned Product and verify compliance with these terms, the refund will be approved and processed according to the type of refund you have selected in your return request: reimbursement or coupon.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Should you opt for a <strong>reimbursement</strong>, we will repay you by using the same payment method used for the initial transaction. Should the original payment method be not valid anymore for whatever reason (e.g., account deleted or credit card expired), you must specify it in the comment section of your return request, expressly detailing the reason and the preferred method of payment. The refund amount will be calculated according to the rules and deductions outlined above (e.g., return shipping costs, restocking fees, etc.). Reimbursement will be issued within fourteen (14) days, barring circumstances beyond our reasonable control. However, we reserve the right to postpone the refund if we have not yet received the returned Products for inspection in such a period of time.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Should you opt for a <strong>coupon</strong>, a coupon code will be issued within fourteen (14) days for use on our Website at checkout for another purchase. This code will have a reasonably extended validity period. The refund will cover the full amount paid for the relevant Product, without any deductions, unless restocking fees are applicable.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong><em>Return Exceptions</em></strong></p>

      <p>As permitted by law, your right of withdrawal does not apply in the following cases:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Products labelled as <em>&ldquo;Non-Returnable&rdquo;</em> or with similar labelling on the product page or at checkout cannot be returned or refunded for any reason, unless they have a proven and confirmed manufacturing defect. <em>(This exception applies only to purchases made in the United States and Canada.)</em></li>
        <li>Products that are manufactured or produced in accordance with an individual choice or specification or according to personalised needs or designs, including the Custom Orders pursuant to Article 12 above.</li>
        <li>Products that have been altered from their original condition, worn, or washed.</li>
        <li>Products which have been unsealed after delivery and which cannot be returned for reasons of hygiene or health protection, including but not limited to underwear, swimwear, hygiene masks, and any other items we reasonably consider to fall into this category.</li>
        <li>Products likely to deteriorate or expire rapidly.</li>
        <li>Alcoholic beverages, if the price was agreed at the time of purchase, delivery is only possible after 30 days, and the final value is subject to market fluctuations beyond our control.</li>
        <li>Products that have been inseparably mixed with other products due to their texture, after delivery.</li>
        <li>Any other products or services excluded by current regulations.</li>
      </ul>
