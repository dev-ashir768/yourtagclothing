      <p>You may withdraw your consent at any time without retroactively affecting the processing of personal data carried out up to that time.</p>

      <p>The contents of the Platform are intended for general public access and are freely available to Internet users worldwide. However, to create a user account or subscribe to our newsletter, you must acknowledge that you are legally capable of sharing your personal data, in accordance with applicable data protection regulations.</p>

      <p>In the forms on the Platform, it will be necessary for you to fill in the fields marked as &ldquo;obligatory.&rdquo; Failure to provide all the personal data required may result in the request being incomplete.</p>

      <p>You must provide current personal data to ensure the information collected is updated and error-free.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR DATA</strong></p>

      <p>We process the personal data you provide for the following purposes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Enabling features and functionality of the Platform.</li>
        <li>Fulfilling your requests for our products and services.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>We use non-personally identifiable information to monitor the use and performance of the Platform. This helps us learn more about how people use the Platform and improve our products and services. We use your name and email address to communicate with you about your account and to send you notification emails. You can adjust the frequency of these emails in your User Account&rsquo;s settings.</p>

      <p>Depending on the products, services, or functionalities you wish to use, we may need to process different types of data, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Identification data (e.g., your name, surname, image, language, country, and contact details).</li>

      </ul>

      <p>When we ask you to provide personal data to access a feature or service on the Platform, mandatory fields will be marked. This data is necessary to provide the service or feature. If you choose not to provide this information, you may not be able to complete your registration or use certain services or functionalities.</p>

      <p>In some cases, we may collect information passively using tracking tools such as browser cookies or similar technologies on our Platform or in communications we send to you.</p>

      <p>A third party may provide us with information about you when you use a Platform feature or service, such as if you receive a gift card or if an order is shipped to your address. In these cases, we will process your data in connection with that functionality or service in accordance with this policy.</p>

      <p>When you subscribe, have previously subscribed, initiate a purchase, or otherwise provide your contact details during a transactional interaction (such as adding items to your cart or starting checkout), you agree to receive service-related communications from us via email, SMS, or WhatsApp. These may include shopping cart or checkout reminders, order updates, and other relevant transactional information. These messages may be sent using automated technology.</p>

      <p>If you have explicitly opted in to receive marketing communications from yourtagclothing through one of the consent mechanisms available on our Platform, you will receive special offers, promotion codes, catalogue news, and trends from yourtagclothing and may also receive carefully selected content and offers from other Netenders Group platforms (including but not limited to yourtagclothing, Needen&reg;, Ntextil&reg;, Egotier&reg;) offering complementary products or services aligned with your expressed interests. These communications are designed and sent by our internal marketing team, and never involve any external data sharing or third-party advertising. You may unsubscribe or withdraw your consent at any time by clicking the &ldquo;Unsubscribe&rdquo; link in any message or by contacting us directly at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:data@netenders.com">data@netenders.com</a>.</p>

      <p>Your personal data will be preserved until you request its deletion.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>ABOUT UPLOADING AND POSTING INFORMATION</strong></p>

      <p>When you register for a User Account, you will choose a username and password. Your username will be visible to other customers when you upload a design, post a comment, or message on the Platform. If your comment or message contains personal information and is posted on a publicly accessible page, third parties may note this information, potentially leading to unsolicited messages from other parties.</p>

      <p>Any content or information you upload is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>Always exercise caution when posting such information.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>DATA COLLECTED BY WEB BEACONS AND LOG FILES</strong></p>

      <p>We also collect certain non-personally identifiable information through the use of web beacons and log files. This information may include your IP address, browser type, Platform usage, and whether you opened emails you received from us.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>HOW WE SECURE YOUR DATA</strong></p>

      <p>To protect your personal data, we take reasonable precautions and use commercially reasonable and generally accepted technological safeguards to secure any information we collect about you. This ensures that it is not inappropriately lost, misappropriated, accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. The Secure Server Software (SSL) we use encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Additionally, your user account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. You should always take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you select.</p>

      <p>We will ensure the confidentiality and security of your personal data, protecting it from any unauthorised access or use that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to you.</p>

      <p>In compliance with the applicable data protection legislation, any cross-border transfers of personal data will only be conducted in strict accordance with the provisions outlined therein. This ensures that necessary safeguards and protections are implemented, guaranteeing the confidentiality and security of personal data in the receiving country, making such transfers legal under data protection legislation.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>HOW DO WE SHARE OR DISCLOSE YOUR DATA</strong></p>

      <p>We may share your personal information with subsidiaries, partner companies of the Netenders Group, and trusted service providers and partners that support us in delivering information and services to you. We ensure appropriate safeguards to secure your data during such sharing.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Sharing with Third Parties</em></strong></p>

      <p>To fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, we may need to provide access to your personal data to third parties that support our services. These third parties may act as joint controllers and include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Financial institutions.</li>
        <li>Fraud detection and prevention entities.</li>
        <li>Technology and analytics service providers.</li>
        <li>Logistics, transport, and delivery service providers or their partners.</li>
        <li>Customer service providers.</li>
        <li>Marketing and advertising partners, such as advertising agencies, advertising partners, or social networks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These third parties are required to use the information only for the purpose for which it was provided and in accordance with our Privacy Policy. For example, if you sign up for a promotional offer or enrol in a service offered in partnership with a third party, we may share your name, email address, and account activity with such third parties.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Cross-boarding Transfers</em></strong></p>

      <p>If you agree to this Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to the international transfer of the information you provide to us. Some service providers are located in regions that do not offer data protection equivalent to that of the European Union. In such cases, we transfer your data with appropriate safeguards, using tools like Standard Contractual Clauses or other relevant supplementary measures to maintain data security.</p>

      <p>Notably, the European Commission&#39;s decision on 10 July 2023 regarding the EU-US Data Privacy Framework allows the secure transfer of personal data from the EU to US entities participating in the framework, ensuring a level of protection comparable to that in the EU.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Automated Decision-Making</em></strong></p>

      <p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal data, including profiling.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Corporate Transactions</em></strong></p>

      <p>In the event of an acquisition, merger, sale, or transfer of all or part of our business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the potential recipient. We will use reasonable efforts to ensure the recipient treats your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We have a legitimate interest in disclosing your data during such corporate reorganisations.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Legal Compliance and Protection</em></strong></p>

      <p>We may release information when we believe it is necessary or appropriate to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>comply with laws, government regulations, or court decisions ;</li>
        <li>comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders, government investigations, or other legal processes ;</li>
        <li>enforce or apply the terms of our user or licence agreements ;</li>
        <li>investigate or respond to allegations of fraud, intellectual property infringement, or other unlawful activities ;</li>
        <li>protect our or our customers&rsquo; rights, property, or safety.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For example, if your transaction is processed through a payment gateway located in the United States, your information used to complete the transaction may be subject to disclosure under US law, including the Patriot Act.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</em></strong></p>

      <p>We may disclose non-personally identifiable information to third parties in aggregate form to potential business partners and investors.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>HOW TO CHANGE, DELETE, OR UPDATE MY DATA</strong></p>

      <p>Most of your account information can be changed in the My Account section of the Platform.

After receiving proof of your identity, we will provide the information to you, and you may request that we delete or change any or all of the information.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>

      <p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Therefore, we invite you to check it regularly. Changes and clarifications will be effective as soon as they are published on the Platform.</p>

      <p>If we make substantial changes to the content of this Privacy Policy, and you are a registered user or subscriber, we will notify you here when it is updated. This ensures you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

      <p>If our Platform is acquired by or merged with another company, your information may be transferred to the new owners so that we can continue to sell products to you.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>RIGHTS OVER YOUR DATA</strong></p>

      <p>You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, and port your data, as well as object to its processing or withdraw your consent to the processing of your data. To exercise these rights or any other rights granted under applicable data protection legislation, please contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:data@netenders.com">data@netenders.com</a> or by sending a letter to:</p>

      <p>If you do not receive a satisfactory response or if you wish to make a complaint or obtain further information about any of these rights, you may contact the Data Protection Authority or the Government Data Protection Agency.</p>

      <p>Since the Netenders Group holding is located within the EU, this Privacy Policy is designed to comply with the highest security standards set by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU-GDPR). If you are accessing our Platform from outside the EU, different data protection legislation may apply.</p>
